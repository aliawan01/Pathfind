TODO UI:
- Menu for algorithms -> Selecting between manhattan distance and euclidean distance, setting speed of the algorithms.
- Run algorithm
- Menu for mazes -> vertical/horizontal skew for recursive division.
- Resetting nodes (path nodes, all marked nodes, checked nodes etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts?
- Theme -> Selecting themes and making your own theme (UIColorPickerDialogue)
- Changing betweeen marked node and weighted node (being able to specify the weight of the weighted node)
- Messages (e.g. if there is no path)
- Legend for the meaning of different icons.
- Getting started/help guide.
- Networking
- Zooming in and out of the grid.
- Find out how long it takes for the algorithm to solve it and show it in the UI.
- Could make a button which when clicked will change the text in other buttons and menus to show shortcuts
  (e.g. 'r' to run the pathfinding algorithms).

FIX:
- Fix bug with networking where the recursive division maze crashes with the following message
    (also crashes without networking, when running recursive division with minimum speed):
  `Process finished with exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005)`,
  * Could be a problem with using pygame.time.set_timer() for every frame?
  * Extra information: Could be that the game crashes when we try to place a node when the recursive division is running
    could be fixed by experimenting with enabling screen lock? (seem to see this message before the game crashes:
    `[CLIENT RECEIVED EVENT]: Received an event -> {"1": [[169, 151]]}`),
    UPDATE: Seemed to have reduced the chances of it crashing by changing the .recv value in networking to 100000.
  * Maybe the spinning square could be causing the issue (check this by removing it and seeing if the bug persists)?
  * The issue seems to be happening because we are using properties to get the colours (and we are also using properties
    to get information from rect_array).
- Recursive division crashes if the animations go too fast?
- USE faulthandler TO FIND THE STACKTRACE OF WHERE IT CRASHES!
- Could also try to remove the .idea folder and set everything up again to see it if fixes the problem (could also
  be a problem with the current version of the interpreter).
- Allow the user to just close the window and it will shut down it's connection to the server as well
  (if it is already implemented it doesn't seem to be working properly).
- Try removing the try except statements from function get_start_and_end_coords and see if the
    networking will crash.
- Fix bug with resizing not working in the networking when you change the slider quickly.

- Remove print statements in theme window after you have finished
- Change the '->' in the buttons to go the next and previous pages in windows to something else (could be an image or another icon).
- Tooltips! (and find a way to theme them as well).
- Turn `color` into `colour` wherever possible in the codebase (use search and replace but be careful not to change any of pygame's Color)
- Remove commented code to run algorithms in main.py
- Fix start and end nodes not animating properly.
- May have accidentally fixed issues with recursive division crashing in networking?!! Keep on checking to make sure (there may also be some issue
  with the stacks not being reset when resizing the grid after running a maze generation algorithm but I think it fixed itself as well).
- Go through all of the TODO in the project.
- Finish making the tutorial window
- Fix bug so that if the path goes over a weighted node then the path node should be drawn on top of the weighted node.

TODO:
- Play music when the user places and deletes nodes, or when a path is being shown.
- Be able to tell the user that there isn't any path (we know that there isn't a path
  when the path stack is empty {in other words it is full of None values})
- Allow the user to specify weights when selecting them (could use a menu in the UI)
  change it in the networking part as well.
- Turn the queues in queue_classes.py into actual queues
 - Add the grid_height_offset thing to the networking so that the grid is the same on all clients (could be useful
   if we allow the client to resize the ui?)
- Screen lock for when the client is using the UI since it will mark nodes on the grid otherwise.
- Fix bidirectional search so that it is faster
- Remove print statements.
- Creating network events when doing things in the GameUIManager.
- Could have it such that the weighted node's color will be darker if it has a higher weight and lighter if it
  has a smaller weight.
- Localization to support different languages in the UI.

- Make and set the game's icon.
- Replace the weights with an image (could use different colours).
- Replacing start and end nodes with images (could add different colours).
- Add the UI

FINISH:
- Adding images and the UI

IDEAS:
- Fullscreen/rescaling?
- Could add the spinning cube as an animation option.
- Could add print statements to debug the threading problem with the rect_array not being updated after changing
  the resolution divider in networking.

NOTES:
- Remember to set the if statement for the screen_lock to be on after you
  have finished testing stuff.
- Remember to remove print statements in the networking after you have finished with it.
- (Having issues with performance using this) Use pygame.gfxdraw to fix the issue with fuzzy circles in the light
  theme (gfxdraw will draw an outline of the circle, and we can just draw it on top of the normal filled circles we draw).

BUG FIXES:
- Fix bug where astar and greedybfs (and sometimes dijakstra) doesn't draw the path even though it reaches the end node.
- Fix bug where the start and end node animations will not work and the animations for changing colours also are not working.
- Fix bug with not different classes not being able to access the rect_array new coordinates immediately after resizing the grid.

INFO:
Default gradient for the dark theme border:
        # default gradient of Normal Border: "normal_border": "#FFB0B0,#FFB0FF,0"
