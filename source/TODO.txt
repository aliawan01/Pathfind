TODO:
- Lock the screen when drawing paths so that the user cannot mark more nodes.
- Be able to tell the user that there isn't any path (we know that there isn't a path
  when the path stack is empty {in other words it is full of None values})
- Abstract get_valid_adjacent_nodes into rectArray class.
- Add a way to unmark already marked nodes.


FINISH:
- Turn lists in stacks and fix the bugs which come with such responsiblity...
- Use self.parent_child_dict to backtrack and find out the shortest path.

IDEAS:
- Fullscreen/rescaling?
