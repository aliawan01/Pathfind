TODO:
- Play music when the user places and deletes nodes, or when a path is being shown.
- Be able to tell the user that there isn't any path (we know that there isn't a path
  when the path stack is empty {in other words it is full of None values})
- Allow the user to specify weights when selecting them (could use a menu in the UI)
  change it in the networking part as well.

- Turn the queues in queue_classes.py into actual queues

- In the menu add a way to add a vertical skew, horizontal skew, euclidean and manhattan distance
 - Add the grid_height_offset thing to the networking so that the grid is the same on all clients (could be useful
   if we allow the client to resize the ui?)

- Fix bidirectional search so that it is faster

- Make and set the game's icon.
- Replace the weights with an image (could use different colours).
- Replacing start and end nodes with images (could add different colours).
- Add the UI

FINISH:
- Adding images and the UI

IDEAS:
- Fullscreen/rescaling?

NOTES:
- Remember to set the if statement for the screen_lock to be on after you
  have finished testing stuff.
- Remember to remove print statements in the networking after you have finished with it.
- (Having issues with performance using this) Use pygame.gfxdraw to fix the issue with fuzzy circles in the light
  theme (gfxdraw will draw an outline of the circle, and we can just draw it on top of the normal filled circles we draw).

BUG FIXES:
- Fix bug where astar and greedybfs (and sometimes dijakstra) doesn't draw the path even though it reaches the end node.
- Fix bug where the start and end node animations will not work and the animations for changing colours also are not working.
