TODO:
- Be able to tell the user that there isn't any path (we know that there isn't a path
  when the path stack is empty {in other words it is full of None values})

- Turn the queues in queue_classes.py into actual queues

- In the menu add a way to add a vertical skew, horizontal skew, euclidean and manhattan distance

- Fix scaling when resolution_divider is greater than 4

- Create client and server classes and send events through e.g. MarkStartNode, ResetWeightedNodes etc.

FINISH:
- Networking

IDEAS:
- Fullscreen/rescaling?

NOTES:
- Remember to set the if statement for the screen_lock to be on after you
  have finished testing stuff.
