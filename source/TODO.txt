TODO:
- Be able to tell the user that there isn't any path (we know that there isn't a path
  when the path stack is empty {in other words it is full of None values})

- Make a general function to setup and call all the pathfinding algorithms.

- Turn the queues in queue_classes.py into actual queues

- Rename the run_... methods in the pathfinding classes to just run.

- In the menu add a way to add a vertical or horizontal skew

FINISH:
- Add mazes


IDEAS:
- Fullscreen/rescaling?

NOTES:
- Remember to set the if statement for the screen_lock to be on after you
  have finished testing stuff.
