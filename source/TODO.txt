TODO:
- Play music when the user places and deletes nodes, or when a path is being shown.
- Replace the weights with an image.
- Be able to tell the user that there isn't any path (we know that there isn't a path
  when the path stack is empty {in other words it is full of None values})
- Allow the user to specify weights when selecting them (could use a menu in the UI)
  change it in the networking part as well.
- Fix bug where astar and greedybfs (and sometimes dijakstra) doesn't draw the path even though it reaches the end node.
- Allowing the user to set colors and change themes from dark to light.

- Turn the queues in queue_classes.py into actual queues

- In the menu add a way to add a vertical skew, horizontal skew, euclidean and manhattan distance

- Find how to fix bidirectional search so that it is faster)

- Being able to set and use different colours.
- Add the NetworkingEventType.CHANGE_THEME option, once you have finished with the colours.

FINISH:
- Adding colors and changing themes. (also add it to the networking stuff)

IDEAS:
- Fullscreen/rescaling?

NOTES:
- Remember to set the if statement for the screen_lock to be on after you
  have finished testing stuff.
- Remember to remove print statements in the networking after you have finished with it.
